__Concentration of Chronic Conditions (CCC)__ (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32233970/)
The definition of CCC is in the attached article. The numbers are on a scale of -16 -- 16 with 16 being high.

__Comorbidities__ (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6929a1.htm?s_cid=mm6929a1_w)
The numbers are the percentage of the population that have any of these chronic conditions: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis; heart disease (angina or coronary heart disease, heart attack, or myocardial infarction); diabetes; chronic kidney disease; or obesity (body mass index â‰¥30 kg/m2)

__urban_code__ (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32233970/)
This is the rural/urban classification that we are using. The deifintions are in the Results section in page 3 and Table 2 in page 4. 6_non_core and 5_micropolitan is rural, 4_small_metro and 3_mdedium_metro are mid-sized and 2_large_fringe and 1_large_central are urban.

__COVID-19 data__ (date 01-17-2021)
- _confirmed rate_: no. of confirmed cases per 100,000
- _death rate_: no. of deaths per 100,000
- _fatality rate_: no. of deaths / no. of confirmed. The no. of confirmed is from 01-07-2021. So it is adjusted by 10 days.
- _Population_: The population of the county
